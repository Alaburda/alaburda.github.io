Hello there! I'm Paulius Alaburda, I'm a data analyst with a background in energy, statistics, medicine, biology and insurance. Having finished medschool in 2018, I pursued a career in data - and to be fair, I never looked back! I believe a great data analyst is someone who understands the code they write or the tools they use but also has the ability to explain their results to someone.
